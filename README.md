# Prediction-with-Binomial-Logistic-Regression

# Introduction
- the "Prediction with Binomial Logistic Regression" repository! This repository contains code and resources for performing binary classification tasks using binomial logistic regression.
- Bank Marketing Dataset Analysis and Predictive Modeling:**
- Objective: Predict whether a client has subscribed to a term deposit or not.

# Methodology  
Define the binary classification task and the target variable for each use case.

## Data Acquisition and Exploration:
- Collect datasets from reliable sources and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions and relationships.

## Data Preprocessing:
- Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features as needed.

## Model Selection and Training:
- Select logistic regression as the classification algorithm and train the model on the preprocessed data.

## Model Evaluation:
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics. Visualize performance metrics using appropriate plots.

## Inference:
- Interpret model coefficients to understand feature importance and deploy the trained model for real-world predictions.

# Business Impact
- The developed predictive model can assist the bank in optimizing its marketing strategies by targeting clients more likely to subscribe to term deposits.
- This can lead to improved campaign effectiveness and increased term deposit subscriptions, ultimately benefiting the bank's bottom line.

# Conclusion  
- The application of binomial logistic regression in these use cases demonstrates its effectiveness in predicting binary outcomes and deriving actionable insights from data.
- By leveraging machine learning techniques and thorough analysis, organizations can make informed decisions and drive business growth.

# Results
- The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 90% on the test dataset.
